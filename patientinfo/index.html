      <h1 id="Your-Appointment">Your Appointment</h1>
      <p>At your first appointment, you can expect Dr. Chang to provide a complete examination that includes a diagnosis of any dental decay (cavities) and periodontal disease (gum disease) present, and a screening for oral cancer.  Also included is a review of your medical and dental history as well as radiographs (x-rays) to help us determine the best plan of action for achieving and maintaining your dental health.  If you have a primary concern or issue you would like Dr. Chang to take special note of, please inform her of this so she can best address your concerns in the context of your entire dental health.</p>
      <p>Following the examination, Dr. Chang and our team will go over her findings and inform you of the treatment she recommends.  If you have dental insurance, we will inform you of your available benefits for dental treatment and an estimate of your out-of-pocket portion at your request.  With this information, you can make a well-informed decision about your dental care.  We are here to help you achieve and maintain optimal dental health, so do not hesitate to ask us any questions you may have.  We will do our best to try and answer them.</p>
