Welcome! We're excited to introduce you to our new website experience! Its been a long time in the making and we're happy to share this new online channel for you all to keep in touch with us!

We've added information all over the site to help you all get to know us and also to help familiarize you all with what exactly we do at our dental office. In the 'Dental Care' and 'Patient Information' sections you'll find a summary of the services we provide and an overview of a typical first appointment. Before coming in, you can get to know our team by checking out the 'About Us' section! We've placed our staff bios there along with a short team description of our journey here. Our social links can be found at the bottom of every page, we're on Facebook, Google+, Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter. Lastly, you can get in touch with us via the 'Contact Us' page; there you'll find our phone number and a google map of our office location.
