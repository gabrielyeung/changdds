    <h1>Dentures</h1>
    <p>For patients with many missing teeth, a removable denture can be made that is worn during waking hours and removed during sleeping hours.  The two main types of removable dentures are complete dentures and partial dentures.</p>
    <p>Complete dentures are made when a patient is missing all of his or her teeth in an arch.  For example, if all the upper teeth are missing, an upper complete denture can be made to replace all of those teeth.  The same would apply for patients with all lower teeth missing.</p>
    <p>Partial dentures are made when a patient is missing some, but not all, of his or her teeth in the upper or lower jaw.  Partial dentures thus replace any missing teeth in that arch (upper or lower), and are generally supported and kept in the mouth by the remaining teeth or implants.</p>
    <p>The process for making a complete or partial denture typically takes at least five appointments over a span of 5 to 6 weeks from start to finish, given that the gums and teeth are healthy.  For more information, please read our blog entry about dentures, or you can e-mail or call us.</p>
