    <h1>Exams and X-rays</h1>
    <p>Dr. Chang strongly believes that regular dental exams are the foundation for maintaining excellent oral health, because it allows for us, as your dental team, to evaluate your existing dental condition and to diagnose any new problems or disease that may arise.  Included in each exam appointment is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A thorough head and neck evaluation for any signs of abnormal growths, potential tumors, and TMJ (jaw joint) issues.</li>
        <li>A thorough evaluation of soft tissues inside the mouth, which includes your lips, gums, cheeks, tongue, and throat for signs of possible tumors, disease processes, or abnormalities.</li>
        <li>A complete examination of your teeth to diagnose cavities, the status of any existing restorations (fillings, crowns, bridges), the alignment of your bite, signs of grinding or clenching, cracked teeth, sensitive teeth, or any other tooth-related problems you may be having.</li>
        <li>If applicable, the status of any removable appliance that you may wear, such as a removable full denture, partial denture, retainer, or night-guard.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dental x-rays are a routine part of our dental exams, and are generally recommended to be taken once a year.  Dental x-rays help us see areas that we cannot see as clearly inside the mouth, such as areas between the teeth and the roots of the teeth.  Dental x-rays are recommended for all patients with teeth, including children (at an age when they can tolerate an x-ray in their mouths), pregnant women (studies show that the radiation levels of dental x-rays is not harmful for the baby or mother while she is pregnant), and elderly patients.  Without dental x-rays, it is impossible for our team to fully assess and diagnose any problems with your teeth, and therefore difficult to provide the best care possible for you as our patient.</p>
    <p>Depending on your existing oral health, Dr. Chang may recommend exams every 3-to-12 months, with the typical interval between exams being 6 months.</p>
