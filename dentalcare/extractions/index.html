    <h1>Extractions</h1>
    <p>In unfortunate situations, a tooth can be too far decayed, cracked, or unrestorable to try and treat it with a filling, crown, or root canal treatment.  We are dedicated to helping our patients keep the God-given teeth that they have, because nothing can adequately replace those teeth.  However, if the prognosis of a tooth, or likelihood of keeping the tooth, is poor, then we will recommend removing the tooth and discuss options to replace the tooth.</p>
    <p>We can perform most extractions in our office, but in special cases, such as if the tooth is too badly broken down, the roots are too curved, the patient has complex medical conditions, or for most wisdom teeth, we will refer our patients to an oral surgeon, a dentist that specializes in surgery and extractions.  This will ensure that our patients get the best treatment available and are as comfortable as possible during the process.</p>
