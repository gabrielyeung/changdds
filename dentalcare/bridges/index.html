    <h1>Bridges</h1>
    <p>In certain circumstances when a dental implant is not recommended to replace missing teeth, a dental bridge is another good option.</p>
    <p>A dental bridge consists of using the two teeth that are next to the missing space as abutments, or support structures, to anchor the dental bridge. The dental bridge will then span across the missing space and replace the space with something that looks and functions like a tooth. The entire bridge is connected together, and cavities and gum disease can still affect the abutment teeth of the bridge. Even though keeping the teeth and gums around the bridge clean can be difficult, it is very important in extending the life of the bridge.</p>
