        <p class="mobile-show">Dr. Quyen Chang is a dedicated family dentist who is committed to establishing and maintaining the health of your teeth and mouth.  She displays an unparalleled level of gentleness and care for all of her patients, which she couples with her expertise and skill to provide excellent dental care in the Triangle area.  She is a proud member of the American Association of Women Dentists and the Raleigh-Wake County Dental Society.</p>
        <p>Dr. Chang received her undergraduate degree at Meredith College in Raleigh, North Carolina, and graduated from the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry.  Not longer after she graduated, she opened her own practice in Raleigh, where she has been practicing for over 30 years.  Over the years, Dr. Chang has developed a countless number of relationships through providing dental care and restoring oral health in her community.  She has cherished these opportunities and continues to value getting to know her patients on both the dental and non-dental front.  Her ability to connect with patients is partly attributed to her fluency in four different languages: English, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>Dr. Chang is happily married to her husband, David, and together they have two sons, Timothy and Joshua.  Outside of her dental practice, Dr. Chang enjoys traveling, gardening, swimming, and Sudoku puzzles.  She is also an active member at her church, Raleigh Chinese Christian Church, where she has been attending for over 25 years.</p>

      <section class="history">
        <h1 id="Our-History">History of the Practice</h1>
        <p>In 1988, Dr. Quyen Chang opened the doors to her practice to the Raleigh community.  As one of the first dentists of Asian descent practicing in the area at the time, she steadily grew a loyal patient base simply by word-of-mouth and internal referrals.  Patients always complimented her incredible kindness and gentleness in the care she provided, and the relationships that were built in the practice continued to flourish.</p>
        <p>After thirty years, the Dr. Chang continues to provide quality dental care for her patients, and relies heavily on word-of-mouth referrals from her trusted patients to continue serving the Raleigh community.  She feels blessed for each and every day that she is able to help her patients achieve and maintain a healthy smile, all the while building meaningful and lasting relationships.</p>
